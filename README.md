On the this day, we had a session about basic 3D design, and we were used “Rhinoceros 3D” to design 3D models.You can use a y 3d designing software.After 3D Image design, A brief explanation about conversion of “model.stl format to model.gecode” using cura(Gecode Converter) was also given.After the session about the basics, the students were asked to design a simple 1cm x 1cm x 1cm block to be printed using the Ultimaker 2+ 3D Printer.

### Steps to print

```markdown
$ After 3D Image design,then extract to “model.stl" 
$ Now open the "stl" file in cura
$ Now select object as you want
$ Now select save in the right bottom
$ Now it will be "model.gecode
$ Copy it into the printer
$ Start printing
```
